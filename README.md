This is a plugin for VSCode that provides an interactive programming experience for the TypeScript programming language. 


## Features

### Develop faster


### Reason locally
Debugging one function shouldn't require running the entire program. 

### Make exploration easy
It should not be a chore to do good things. Running code is ultimately how we know it works. The ability to do this easier and faster has compunding effects on software development. 

### Combine getting it working with it working
A REPL integrated with project files means you can interact with code one locally one moment and ship it the next.

### Code in files

### Evaluate any code in any file

### Interact with your software
